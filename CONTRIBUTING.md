# Contributing to AppBot
There are various ways to contribute to AppBot, wether it's just helping it grow, or helping other users use the bot.
## Contributing via Support in Help Server
Getting this position is no longer easy, but it's still possible. Start by getting well-known in the help server. Gain a postive reputation in the server by helping others and keeping conversations going. If you look like you're good for the job, you might just be asked to help.
## Contributing via GitHub Repository
The GitHub Repository is mainly only for documentation and help. Just like the help server, you need to know the bot really well, including problems, commands, etc. Once you get well-known and contribute a lot in the help server, you might be able to help me with the GitHub repository. Most people won't want to help here though, because you're only going to be helping me write things like Documentation.
## Other Ways of Contributing
If you don't really care about what's listed above, simply sharing the bot is already contributing. This includes upvoting the bot. It's really appreciated and encouraged, and helps the bot get more updates and fixes. 
You can also report bugs and send in requests for new features in the help server.
